# Inspiration
We were mainly inspired by the game Kind Words on Steam. We also noticed the loneliness many people felt during the pandemic.

# What it does
This app allows users to write messages to express their worries and more importantly, share words of encouragement.

# How we built it
We built the app using JavaScript, Firebase, HTML and CSS. We mainly used HTML/CSS to design the frontend. To make the UI more responsive, we used JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.
Firebase was used to store data about user posts and replies.

# Challenges we ran into
The hardest part was about integrating Firebase with the front end. 

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to create an app that's helpful during the pandemic. Our goal is to do our best to support people during such difficult times.

# What we learned
- Javascript isn't type safe and this creates a host of issues.

# What's next for Reassure
- Making sure that the users will not receive the same message twice in a row
- Adding support for multimedia uploads, such as photos and videos
- Using AI to ensure the positivity of user messages (look into sentiment analysis)
